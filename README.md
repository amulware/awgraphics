# Bearded.Graphics

This is a C# OpenGL graphics library build on top of [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk).

Our goal is wrapping the static OpenGL interface into a nicer object-oriented one and providing various layers of abstractions to make setting up programs and games consuming OpenGL much easier.

At the same time, performance is very important to us, and we strive to reduce any overhead introduced by these abstractions to a minimum.

## Is this library being used anywhere?

Sure is:

- [Bearded.TD](https://github.com/beardgame/td)
- _your project here (get in touch!)_

Older versions of the library were used in:
- [Roche Fusion](https://rochefusion.com)
- [Photones](https://github.com/photones/photones)


## Current state of the library

We recently (2020) went through a complete rewrite and refactor. This second version of the library has a significantly improved API and some great new features. Our work is far from complete however, and it may never be, as even if we mirrored all of OpenGL, there would be innumerable layers of abstractions we could add to make our lives easier.

We'll keep improving and adding to what we have, and we are always happy to accept outside contributions as well!
